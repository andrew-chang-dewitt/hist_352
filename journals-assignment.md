# journals

instructions from syllabus:

> 1. This is a seminar-style course; therefore, students can determine the
>    direction discussion takes much of the time. To that end, all students
>    must keep a responsive journal (i.e. a series of typed sheets; one sheet
>    due per class session for which such notes are required).
>
>    Each sheet should be at one double-spaced page in length. Essentially,
>    your journal sheets should be lists of things in the readings that you:
>
>    1. found particularly interesting
>    2. had trouble understanding
>    3. can give additional interesting examples of
>    4. strongly agree or disagree with
>    5. want to comment on for one reason for another.
>
> Always note the text page numbers of the items you are commenting on.

& related policy regarding late submission:

> 5. Late turn-in of assignments: The instructor reserves the right to decrease
>    by 20% of the value of each journal assignment for each class session it
>    is turned in late. For example, if a journal is turned in a class session
>    late, it might only receive 8 total points instead of 10. The instructor
>    will communicate any changes in this policy, and all changes will be
>    applied equally to all. The mid-term and final exams will be rescheduled
>    ONLY for those with legitimate reasons for missing the scheduled test
>    dates; otherwise, you stand to lose all the points for those exams.
