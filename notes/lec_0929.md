## ethnicity & reform in early 1900s chicago

ethnic clustering in chicago -> segregation

- some groups chose to cluster
- others were told where they could go (irish/black)

all this meant vice was v segregated too

entering the 1910s, segregated vice was seen as threat to social harmony &
virtue -> prohibition movement becoming policy in 1920

this coincided w/ proliferation of automobiles & allowed vice to disperse,
creating things like

- _roadhouses_ in the burbs
- call girls (they came to you by car instead) instead of brothels (you go to
  them)

all of this meant vice districts were smaller, less obvious + prohibition meant
hiding was necessity -> speakeasies & underground vice

all of this was the product of realizing the goals of the **first reform era**,
ironically proving to achieve none of the actual goals of the movement, instead
just symbolically banning the things they did not like

one goal of the reform era was realized to some degree: breaking down of
segregation between ethnic enclaves

jane adams -> labor history museum as a means of reminding younger generations
of the skills & craft of the older generations

disenfranchisement of ethnic groups via law & economics + prohibition -> gangster dei

- gangs had previously been very dominantly anglo/white, but by the 1920s were
  nearly completely composed of recent immigrants & black americans
- bootlegging & speakeasies created means of great economic sucess for those
  willing to break the law

## change in gender roles & class roles vis a vis chicago politics

while for many ethnic minorities, the 1880s-1920s brought about new freedoms &
less segregation, black americans did not experience much of the same growth in
freedoms

post civil war (1865-1877) american gov did try to create legal framework to
create political/legal equality for blacks; however when reconstruction ended,
most of this work was undone & blacks were facing many threats to freedom &
life. Jim Crow south weaponzed the bench to enforce their racism, e.g. Plessy
v. Ferguson -> "separate but equal".

as a result, blacks left the south in droves, entering proffessions that gave
them freedoms they couldn't have in the South (e.g. Pullman porters, northern
manufacturing, ...).
