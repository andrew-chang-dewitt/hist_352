## sex, society, & status

the intersection of gender & class-status in late 1800s Chicago

:::

Spinney's observations on Myra Bradwell & Alta Hulett bring to mind some
interesting patterns regarding social status & the social boundaries placed
on people by their gender:

- Bradwell was likely one of the best connected people there could be in the
  legal profession in Chicago of her time, yet because she was a woman, that
  very profession sought to limit her from joining it in a way they recognized
  (despite her having been effectively practicing it for years already). Her
  persistence first to appeal to all the highest courts in a time when the
  well-educated (by the standards of the time) men seated at those courts said
  things like "the disability imposed by ... your married condition" or "the
  peculiar qualities of womanhood [...] its emotional impulses, its
  subordination of hard reason to sypathetic feeling" [Spinney, ch. 5] is both
  undeniably impressive & simultaneously depressing--for these very same
  sentiments were expressed over & over at the national level just 2 years ago
  in about Kamala Harris & are arguably a major reason why America is currently
  being pulled apart piecemeal by an aspiring fascist with a childish lack of
  emotional control & shockingly pitiful grasp of logic in a mind showing more
  and more to be void of anything other than self-aggrandizement, greed, &
  despicable desires.
- Bradwell's eventual successful bid to join the ranks of bar-admitted lawyers
  follows a similarly familiar pattern&mdash;only by abandoning her ambitions
  for her own career & focusing instead on how to advance the next generation of
  women by championing Hulett's career instead, did Bradwell ever realize
  her own dreams [Spinney, ch. 5]. This pattern of gaining more equal footing
  through incremental gains obtained through the effort, strife, & conflict
  of entire generations' is mirrored in the long path leading to the Civil
  Rights movement of the 1960s & 70s, or the Women's Sufferage movement

Perhaps less obviously impactful on the trajectory of women's rights, the
success of Marshall Fields' department store still paints a picture that
belongs in the same collection as Bradwell's & Hulett's:

- Fields was obsessed with maintaining an image of middle- to upper-class
  success, style, & society for his store, a desire driven by his goal to
  make the store a status symbol for women in the same way as the "downtown
  dinner & smoking clubs" were for the men of Chicago's middle & upper class
  of the time [Spinney, ch. 5].
- This idea of success via consumerism & exclusivity clearly painted a
  picture of where women were allowed to envision themselves when they sought
  success&mdash;a place decidedly different from that of men.

## labor & capital

Chicago as a symbol American inovation & economic success & the human costs

:::

The stories of the massive economic success both Field & Pullman share a
similar theme: the oppression of labor organization & the strict control of not
just the capital output of their workers, but also the choices those workers
made in the free time & personal lives [Spinney, ch. 5].

- Spinney doesn't spend much time on Fields' opinions on labor unions, but the
  line saying Field would fire "any worker who was caught drinking, gambling,
  or associating with labor union officials" indicates quite well what Fields
  thought by dismissing labor rights in the same breath as other behaviors
  found to be detestable by most upright, upper-class citizens of Chicago at
- Pullman's opinons, on the other hand, are made quite clear.
  - It starts, perhaps surprisingly to those who already know the Pullman
    story, painting Pullman as a well-loved, caring figure in the poor, mostly
    black neighborhoods of Chicago's South Side
  - However, Spinney begins to paint the full, darker picture a few paragraphs
    later:
    - beginning with the 1877 Great Railroad Strike, Pullman shows himself to
      be a true capitalist to the core, seeking to leave Chicago as it is a
      place of choice, social connections, & perhaps-limited empowerement for
      workers
    - Builds the Pullman town to have total control over every aspect of
      workers' lives
    - then seeks to squeeze every possible penny out of these trapped workers
      [Spinney, ch. 5]

Pullman's story as an elitist wanna-be dictator posing as a benevlolent
benefactor of the poor ends poorly for him. Faced with a nation-wide rebuke of
his greed by labor manifested as a massive strike accompanied by much sabatoge
& destruction of company assets, Pullman only emerges "victorious" by way of a
tragic (& unfortunately predictible) violent government intervention [Spinney,
ch. 5].
