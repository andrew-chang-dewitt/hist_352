## america first & populist nativism

on Thompson & nativism

:::

- in lecture we touched on the impossibility of defining what "America First"
  really means, both in Thompson's day & today w/ Trump. reading Spinney [ch
  9], it goes into further detail of what Thompson's version of the phrase was
  used to speak to the working class, garnering support from lower economic
  classes instead of the wealthiest chicagoans & business owners

  while Trump's version of "America First" (e.g. "Make America Great Again") is
  often used to gather support from the same people, the implementation of
  policy is starkly contrasting Thompson's&mdash;
  - where Thompson solidified his support of working class voters via economic
    gain (through patronage, not enforcing prohibition, etc.), Trump's economic
    policy soley seeks to benefit the wealthiest Americans & install an
    oligarchy
  - Trump uses immigrants as a scapegoat to foment fear & drive workers to vote
    against their best interests where Thompson talked about ethnic groups to
    unite a coalition _of_ immigrant voters

- there are some obvious similarities, however, between Thompson & Trump:
  - both embrace the use of race in politics as a tool for dividing &
    distracting people
  - neither seems to actually hold any consistent ideology other than the
    desire to hold power

## progressive prohibition

Progressivism ∩ Racism ≡ Prohibition

:::

this quote about Progressive's motivation regarding Prohibition really stands
out:

> Progressive reformers—most of whom were Anglo-American, middle-class, and
> well educated—pursued Prohibition as a way of limiting the power of European
> immigrants [Spinney ch 9]

Did "Progressive" have that different of a political meaning in this time?
Or perhaps it's something akin to today's self-declared "progressive liberals"
who champion NIMBY housing policies & conveniently chose 90%+ white schools for
their kids with extremely well-funded parent organizations?

The paragraphs immediately surrounding this quote read (to me at least) with a
satisfied schadenfreude, pointing out the "supreme irony" of how this
particular motivation for Prohibition backfired on an immense scale [Spinney ch 9].
