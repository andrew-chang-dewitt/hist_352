## ethnicity/class identity & reform/antireform

On the relationship between ethnicity & moral reform/antireform during the last
half of the 19th century:

:::

- Spinney's observation of the alignment of voters to reform/antireform
  politicians based on ethnic identity is unsurprising; however, it was
  surprising to read that mayoral terms were only one year (later two years)
  long. With that inherent instability, it feels almost inevitable that the
  electorate swung strongly between the two sides so consistently [Spinney, pp
  62].

- Similarly surprising (although perhaps not as much): the statistic that
  "3,400 new immigrants arrived" in only one day during this time period. I'd
  seen statistics regarding proportion of immigrants in Chicago for this time
  period before; however, a single-day snapshot like this really helps turn a
  seen statistics regarding proportion of immigrants in Chicago for this time
  period before; however, a single-day snapshot like this really helps turn a
  statistic into something more inherently comprensible [Spinney, pp 62].

- An interesting pattern I noticed was that the ways in which ethnic divisions
  manifested then can be very similar to how they are manifested today:

  1. Our military is known to be disproportionately made up of immigrants &
     those of lower socio-economic class [Spinney, pp 64]
  2. Those identifying as white (remember that most Europeans from Mediteranean
     & Balkan regions were not considered white during much of America's
     history) tend to align with politicians who champion moral reformation
     while those not identifying as white tend to align with politicians who
     champion "liberal" value (e.g. personal/social liberties) [Spinney, pp 64]
  3. Those identifying as white tend to belong to higher socio-economic classes
  4. Because of (2) & (3), those seeking moral reform tend to align with those
     seeking to supress those who do not identify as white, however
     contradictory that might seem.

## urban policy & services

On Chicago's public policy & municipal initiatives of the time:

:::

- While I did already know about how/why the water cribs in Lake Michigan were
  created (i.e. unsanitary water due to pollution in the Chicago River being
  carried to Lake Michigan), I had never read before about the lack of filters
  in the initial installation and the "fishy" results [Spinney, pp 67].
- The city's name for it's first fire engine, "Ye Great Skwirt 'Long John'" is
  just perfectly wonderful [Spinney 65].

## footnotes

- Page numbers are as accurate as I can make them in my citations; however, the
  required texts I have are ebooks (epub format) and don't have page numbers.
  Hopefully these are close enough to work.
