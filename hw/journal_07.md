## transit history

on early el, downtown tunnels, etc.

:::

- two of the descriptions of the early el really stood out to me:

  > The sky is of iron, and perpetually growls a rolling thunder [...]
  > Electric lights are emitting burning sparks; below are wagons of
  > every size and kind, whose approach cannot be heard in the midst of
  > the noise; and the cars, with jangling voice which never ceases,
  > cross and recross [Mayer & Wade, pp 214]

  and

  > If the most noisy place is hell&mdash;surely Chicago must be hell [Mayer & Wade, pp 214]

## immigration/race & housing

on the relationship between housing & race in turn of the century chicago

:::

- the distinction Mayer & Wade make between the poor housing standards available to Black Americans and immigrants says a lot
  - they state "everywhere the Negro moved, the grim specter of segregation was sure to follow" at the same time that they share how most people in Chicago disagreed with limiting housing/jobs/etc. based on race at the time [pp 252]
  - instead, the authors appear to shift the blame to a minority wealthy/elite population w/ outsized power & uncommon desire to limit Black American's options in Chicago
  - given the experiences I hear about today, & stories we're told of Blacks not being allowed to apply for many jobs or go to many schools even in Chicago, I find this assumption of altruism & fairness in most Chicagoans a little hard to believe?
- descriptions of 1900s tenement housing sound like a real urban hell; its hard to imagine anyone ever living in such conditions
